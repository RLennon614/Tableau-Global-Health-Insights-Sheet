🌍 Tableau Project: Global Health Insights Dashboard
📝 Overview
This repository features a comprehensive Tableau Workbook (.twbx) containing visualizations and an interactive dashboard focused on analyzing key global health metrics. The project demonstrates the ability to connect to international health datasets, perform comparative analysis, and communicate complex health trends effectively through data visualization.

✨ Key Skills Demonstrated
This project showcases expertise in the following Business Intelligence (BI) and visualization techniques within the Tableau environment:

I. Data Handling & Preparation
Geospatial Analysis: Utilizing geographic fields (Country/Region) to create map-based visualizations for quick geographical comparisons of health metrics.

Calculated Fields: Creating custom metrics to standardize or derive new health indicators (e.g., mortality rates, life expectancy differences).

II. Visualization & Dashboarding
Dashboard Design: Creating a polished, multi-view dashboard that guides the user through the key insights of the global health data.

Time Series Analysis: Using Line Charts to visualize the evolution of health metrics (e.g., life expectancy, disease prevalence) over time.

Comparative Charts: Employing Bar Charts and Scatter Plots to compare health outcomes across different countries or income groups.

Interactivity: Implementing filters, parameters, and dashboard actions to allow users to interact with the data and focus on specific countries or regions.

III. Analytical Focus
Identifying regional disparities in health outcomes.

Visualizing the relationship between economic factors (implied) and health indicators.

Tracking progress or decline in specific global health targets.
